Problem: 
	Google Fusion is the go-to data tool for web people at Newsday, but Fusion Tables fucking suck. 


Tool to go:
	Here is my region
		How do we define region?
			Counties
			List of Zip Codes?

	Here is my geographic level
		County
	Here is my desired projection
		Equal area (most likely)
		Equal distance

	Here is my display
	Here is my data (autojoin)
	

A lot of this would make sense involving PostGIS.

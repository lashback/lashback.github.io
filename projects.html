			<h3>How the Illinois Legislature voted on the pension overhaul</h3>

			<div class='more_info'>
			<p>On one of those days where the state legislature unexpectedly passes a landmark bill, we had to move quickly. The resulting map demonstrates the upstate-downstate vote split in Illinois and, after some coaxing with our CMS, played nicely with our story.</p>
			<p class='subtitle'>Built with QGIS and Leaflet.js.</p>

			<p>Lovingly referred to as "The Blob" by our staff, this infographic visualized crime data on our university's favorite drinking holiday, showing how activity by out-of-towners increased as the day wore on.</p>

			<p>My first discovery of jQuery binded to D3 events <em>(I can do that?!)</em> visualized how different groups of students applied and enrolled at the U of I varied over the years. Using jQuery events, I was able to guide users through recent enrollment trends.</p>

			<p>When I came across a state bill that would change how the officers of the state university system, I wanted to look at how other states appointed those officers. My reporting also detailed the interesting relationship between the school's alumni groups and legislature.</p>

			<div class='more_info'>
			<p>For a class focused on the 2012 elections, I learned how to analyze survey data to extract statistically significant findings about student voting habits and preferences. This monstrosity, for which we raised money to print on Election Day 2012, details many of those relevant findings.</p>

			<h3>Aerial Disappearances</h3>

			<div class='more_info'>
			<p>When I began to wonder how frequently planes disappear without a trace like MH370, I hypothesized that it's become less and less frequent as tracking technology becomes more advanced. After scraping <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_aerial_disappearances'>this</a> Wiki article, I threw together a quick viz to demonstrate the small and infrequent disappearances in recent decades.</p>

			<p>One of my few writing clips of which I'm proud, this story came about after a woman approached The Daily Illini about her bizzare case of eviction. As I started looking into the legal issues with her case and the tenuous future she and her son would face with the loss of her Section 8 housing voucher, I went about reporting this agonizing story that highlighted some of the deepest issues with housing and landlords in Champaign-Urbana.</p>
